        <h2 id="same">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <font size="3">Online Examination System is a web application that establishes a network between the websites and the students. The website has their own particular sets of questions. These questions are displayed as a test to the eligible students. 

The answers enter by the students are then evaluated and their score is calculated and saved. This score then can be accessed by the students to determine the passes students or to evaluate their performance.
 <br></font>
 <p>Online examination System is being launched because of the need for a destination that is beneficial for both students and institutes. With this site, Students can register themselves to create an individual login IDs .
 
Using this IDs, they can appear for examination on various computer science topics. This will help them to brush up their skills and they will be evaluated according to their performance which is generated by the system after completion of any particular test .

</p>
<p>Online examination System fulfills the requirements of the institutes to conduct the exams online. They do not have to go to any software developer to make a separate site for being able to conduct exams online. 
 
They just have to register on the site and enter the exam details and the lists of the students which can appear in the exam. Students can give exam without the need of going to any 


physical destination. They can view the result at the same time. Thus the purpose of the site is to provide a system that saves the efforts and time of both the institutes and the students.

 
   Online Examination System provides the platform for the students to evaluate their knowledge on various topics of computer science.
</p>
<p>The site has an administrator who keeps an eye on the overall functioning of the system. The site gets revenue by charging the students each time they want to participate in an exam. It is an application software which aims to improve the performance of students and thus making them more capable and aware about their subject , they are dealing with .

It is developed by using ASP.NET using C# and related database.

        <h2 id="same">Database Architecture</h2>
        <p>  The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture. It can be centralized or decentralized or hierarchical. The architecture of a DBMS can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier. An n-tier architecture divides the whole system into related but independent n modules, which can be independently modified, altered, changed, or replaced.

   In 1-tier architecture, the DBMS is the only entity where the user directly sits on the DBMS and uses it. Any changes done here will directly be done on the DBMS itself. It does not provide handy tools for end-users. Database designers and programmers normally prefer to use single-tier architecture.
</p>
<p>If the architecture of DBMS is 2-tier, then it must have an application through which the DBMS can be accessed. Programmers use 2-tier architecture where they access the DBMS by means of an application. Here the application tier is entirely independent of the database in terms of operation, design, and programming.


   
   Database Architecture of this online examination system is made of two different types of database, Authentication database and student database .







  The Authentication Database contains the name, email and password(hashed). It has the email as the primary key and it verifies the email which has been registered. If the email once registered is used up for logging in , the corresponding user will be allowed to use the system . Otherwise, an error page will show up to the user.
</p>
<p>The Student Database contains the Student full name ,email and Score. It keeps the information of the students who appeared for any of the test and also keeps the scores in the database for evaluation of the student and help him decide if he is satisfied with his performance or if he has to improve it .



 The database architecture can be represented in a simple ER diagram in which User, Registration, Examination and Result are the entities and are joined to each other by relationship such as Register, gives , result, receive. Each of the entities have their own set of attributes and there is one multivalued attribute <q>Subject</q>.As of now in this software only the ASP.NET portion is implemented and available. The other topics will be implemented later on.

<h2 id="same">Feasibility Study</h2>
<h3 id="head">What are the user&#39;s demonstrable needs?</h3>
<p>User needs a web-based system, which will remove all the above-mentioned Problems that, the user is facing. The user wants a web-based system, which will reduce the bulk of paperwork, provide ease of work, flexibility, fast record finding, modifying, adding, removing and generating the reports.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="head">How can the problem be redefined?</h3>
<p> We proposed our perception of the system, in accordance with the problems of existing system by making a full layout of the system on paper. We tallied the problems and needs by existing system and requirements. We were further updating in the layout in the basis of redefined the problems. In feasibility study phase we had undergone through various steps, which are described as under: How feasible is the system proposed? This was analyzed by comparing the following factors with both the existing system and proposed system:</p>
<h5 id="some">Cost</h5>
<p>The cost required in the proposed system is comparatively less to the existing system. </p>
<h5 id="some">Effort</h5>
<p>Compared to the existing system the proposed system will provide a better working environment in which their will be ease of work and the effort required will be comparatively less than the existing system. </p>
<h5 id="some">Time</h5>
<p>   Also the time required generating a report or for doing any other work will be comparatively very less than in the existing system. Record finding and updating will take less time than the existing system. </p>
<h5 id="some">Labor</h5>
<p>In the existing system the number of staff required for completing the work is more while the new system will require quite less number of staff.</p>

<aside>Communication Interface: The system should be accessed over LAN or WAN. For Clients to access application server the network should be running TCP/IP protocol. </aside>

<h2 id="same">Projet flow</h2>
        <p>As of now the online examination system is under development and is only meant for taking examination in only one topic of Computer Science i.e ASP .NET using C#.</p>
        <p>In the upcoming days it is planned to uncover more topics such as C, C++, Java, PHP and more students will be participating and using the system. Another short coming is the availability of only Computer Science as a subject for taking test in this system. In the upcoming days it is planned to add further more topics of Engineering such as Electronics and Communication, Information Technology, etc.</p>
